# AutoSave for Parkitect

This mod enables autosaving. Every five minutes your park is saved to AutoSave-{parkname}.txt. You can quicksave your park to QuickSave-{parkname}.txt by pressing F5. Beware!  
Rename your park when you start, otherwise it will overwrite an already existing savegame!  
  
You can set the interval between saves ingame! Go to: settings - mods - AutoSave
